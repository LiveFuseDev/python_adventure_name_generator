# 🏰 Adventure Name Generator

Welcome to the **Adventure Name Generator** — a fun little Python project that creates a fantasy character name and quest location based on your personal input!

This is a practice project based on what I’ve learned so far in the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp** — using `input()`, `print()`, string manipulation, and basic variables. It's simple, creative, and great for reinforcing the basics.

## 💡 What It Does

The script asks the user for a few imaginative inputs:

- A favorite color  
- An animal  
- A number between 1 and 100  

It then combines these into a fantasy-style name and realm to create your custom adventure intro.

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Getting user input with `input()`  
- Printing messages with `print()`  
- Storing data in variables  
- Combining and formatting strings  
- Turning a number into part of a name  
- Having fun with creativity in code!
